##Description

**Trestolone** (**MENT**) is an experimental androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) and progestogen medication under development for potential use as a form of hormonal birth control for men and in androgen replacement therapy for low testosterone levels in men, but has never been marketed for medical use. The compound is an extremely potent 19-nor derivative oft-described as a cross between tren and deca—but without any of the negative sides of either. The compound capable of eliciting serious gains in mass &amp; strength over a relatively short period of time.

Trestolone delivers 10x more myotropic effect of testosterone. Myotropic effect is the effect of building muscle, making trestolone more effective in building muscle than any other commercial steroid in existence. In fact, trestolone outperforms trenbolone by a whopping 250% in this area. It's been called “test on test” or “super-test.”

Trestolone has an anabolic/androgenic rating of 2300:650.  In rats, it was found to be roughly ten times as myotropic as testosterone.

Trestolone is the only steroid in production today that is capable of sustaining normal male physiology in the complete absence of testosterone, including sexual functioning.

The compound gives a positive sense of confidence, euthymia and well-being well over and above that of testosterone or the many DHT derivatives, such as proviron and masteron.


##Dosage

Weekly dosage is low. In clinical studies, the injectable pellets used released between 400-700 micrograms per day as replacement for natural testosterone production values between 4-7 milligrams per day—ten times the strength of testosterone.

A common dose for AAS users is 10 mg per day, or 70 mg per week. Megablast dosages are anywhere from 25-50 mg per day, or 175-350 mg per week.
