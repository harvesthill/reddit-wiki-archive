# Example Cycles

## Beginner Cycles

### Your First Cycle

So, you got interested in steroids and are now trying to figure out where to start.

Beginners have one rule: **KISS**. That stands for "***Keep It Simple, Stupid***." The more chemicals you toss in at once, the bigger your chances of going down in a flaming fireball. **A big, bloated, gyno-y fireball**.

### The Basic Bulk

* See [**Your First Cycle**](/steroids/your_first_cycle.md)

## Intermediate Cycles

### Intermediate Bulk Cycle

By now, you have probably put on a fair bit of mass, and want to see how how much you are capable of. This is a solid second cycle, perfect for putting on mass quickly with minimal side effects. **Nandrolone** also provides excellent joint support, allowing you to push your body a bit harder. At this point you have a bit of a feel for how your body responds to testosterone. You can extend the cycle a bit.

* **Weeks 1-16:** Testosterone [Enanthate](/steroids/testosterone_enthanate.md) or [Cypionate](/steroids/testosterone_cypionate.md), 500 mg/week split *E3.5D*.
* **Weeks 1-16:** [NPP (Nandrolone)](https://www.reddit.com//r/steroids/wiki/deca_durabolin), 50-75 mg/day (350-500mg weekly)
* **Weeks 16-18:** Nothing (This allows the extraneous testosterone to clear your body).
* **Throughout Cycle (or at least on hand):** An AI like [Arimidex](/steroids/arimidex.md) or [Aromasin](/steroids/aromasin.md). Dosing is user dependent and you should get [bloodwork](/steroids/bloodwork/list.md) to dial in your dose. Watch out for [signs of low or high estrogen](/steroids/sides/changes_in_estrogen_levels.md), especially high estrogen, like excessive bloating or itchy nipples. *Do not take AI preemptively*.
* **Take AI only when sides necessitate.** Estrogen is highly anabolic, cardioprotective and neuroprotective, and essential for normal physiological functioning. Low E2 is far worse than high E2, which should be proportionally out of range just as test. Gyno takes weeks to develop and can be taken care of with the AI on hand.

You can extend for up to 20 weeks. If you wish to extend it, obviously all your ending weeks will change and the week you start PCT will as well.

## Equipoise ([Boldenone](/steroids/equipoise.md)) Cycles

[**Equipoise** (**EQ**)](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/equipoise) is a fantastic compound that can be utilized in any cycle for almost any purpose. EQ tends to give users a very healthy-looking reddish-brown hue to their skin tone, almost like a very light base tan.

**Equipoise** tends to visibly increase vascularity in those who are less than 15% body fat, and will grow the delts and traps in a way that makes them look volumized and very full. Some forums have put EQ into their Top 5 list of most important bodybuilding hormones. EQ is equally used in powerlifting circles for the increased rate of recovery and dense dry gains that don't pack on 15+ lbs of water during a cycle.

Some users report an increase in cardiovascular endurance, along with a significant increase in appetite. One of the reported negative side effects of EQ is that some users experience mild anxiety that will increase with the dose. This is due to the **aromatase-inhibiting** effects of **EQ metabolites** ADD, ADT and 1-AD. Have something on-hand to bring estrogen levels back up in case of **crashed E2**: test no ester (TNE or short-ester test, Dianabol, HCG or Trestolone will all do the trick.

For **EQ** to really shine, it needs to be run longer and at higher doses than any other steroid, but it is incredibly mild in terms of side effects and shouldn't be considered in the same class of “mega-dosing,” as with other steroids. 1–1.5 grams is a good dose for the positive properties of EQ to really come into their own. Even a cycle with 2–3 grams of EQ would still be mild.

**EQ** is best run as an accessory compound in a bulk cycle for those looking for that extra pop in their delts.

**EQ** can be run as an accessory to tren on a cut cycle to help mitigate the reduction in cardiovascular capacity that comes along with tren use, while keeping muscle fullness, and helping to avoid looking flat.

**EQ** really shines as the main compound in a recomposition cycle, where it allows you to keep your muscle fullness and vascularity while building a few pounds of muscle and dropping a few percent body fat. **ALWAYS RUN A TEST BASE**.

## Bulk Cycles

### Beginner EQ Bulk

For those with minimal AAS experience this cycle will add around 10–15 lbs of dry lean gains and you won't lose much (if any) during PCT.

* **Weeks 1-16:** [Equipoise](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/equipoise), 200 mg, E3D
* **Weeks 1-24:** [Testosterone Enthanate](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/testosterone_enthanate), 300 mg, E3D
* **Run Testosterone for 8 weeks after dropping EQ to allow the Uncdeylenate ester to clear**.
* On-hand Throughout Cycle: An AI like [Arimidex](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/arimidex) in case signs of excessive bloating or itchy nipples occur. Also have something to bring estrogen levels back up in case of **Crashed E2**: test no ester (TNE) or short-ester test, Dianabol, or HCG will all do the trick.
* **Take AI only when sides necessitate**. Estrogen is highly anabolic, cardioprotective and neuroprotective, and essential for normal physiological functioning. Low E2 is far worse than high E2, which should be proportionally out of range just as test. Gyno takes weeks to develop and can be taken care of with the AI on hand.

### Intermediate EQ Bulk

Keep an AI on hand but you shouldn't need it.

* **Weeks 1-16:** [Equipoise](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/equipoise), 200 mg (E3D)
* **Weeks 1-24:** [Testosterone Enthanate](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/testosterone_enthanate), 300 mg every three days (E3D)
* **Run Testosterone for 8 weeks after dropping EQ to allow the Uncdeylenate ester to clear**.
* On-hand Throughout Cycle: An AI like [Arimidex](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/arimidex) in case signs of excessive bloating or itchy nipples occur. Also have something to bring estrogen levels back up in case of **crashed E2**: test no ester (TNE or short-ester test, Dianabol, or HCG will all do the trick.
* **Take AI only when sides necessitate**. Estrogen is highly anabolic, cardioprotective and neuroprotective, and essential for normal physiological functioning. Low E2 is far worse than high E2, which should be proportionally out of range just as test. Gyno takes weeks to develop and can be taken care of with the AI on hand.

### Advanced EQ Bulk

This cycle ups the dose a bit on the test and EQ and adds in some masteron to help keep the estrogen down and the water off. Recommend running Aromasin proactively to hold down E2

* **Weeks 1-20:** [Equipoise](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/equipoise), 200 mg (E3D)
* **Weeks 1-28:** [Testosterone Enthanate](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/testosterone_enthanate), 300 mg every three days (E3D)
* **Weeks 1-20:** [Masteron Enanthate](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/masteron), 250 mg every three days (E3D)
* **Weeks 1-20:** [Deca-Durabolin](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/deca_durabolin), 200 mg (E3D)
* **Weeks 1-20:** Aromasin, 12.5 mg, E3D — Adjust as needed
* On Hand Throughout Cycle: An AI like [Arimidex](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/arimidex) in case signs of excessive bloating or itchy nipples occur. Also have something to bring estrogen levels back up in case of **crashed E2**: test no ester (TNE or short-ester test, Dianabol, or HCG will all do the trick.
* **Run Testosterone for 8 weeks after dropping EQ to allow the Uncdeylenate ester to clear**.

# Cut Cycles

Just take TRT and eat less you fat lazy fuck

## SUPPLEMENTAL COMPOUNDS 

### Salbutamol

***Salbutamol*** *tablets are also effective while being far less dangerous than Clen:*

* Be sure to get Salbutamol *tablets*, rather than Albuterol inhaler *spray*, which is just a recipe for shakiness and nausea.
* [Positive effects of oral albuterol on serum lipids and carbohydrate metabolism in healthy men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637445/) *Increased HDL, Decreased LDL*
* [More fat burnt in a cardio session with Salbutamol](https://www.ergo-log.com/salbutamoljoules.html)
* [Acute effects of nebulized salbutamol on resting energy expenditure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in healthy subjects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9782220/) *11.4% increase in resting energy expenditure among healthy subjects with Salbutamol*
* [Combination of salbutamol, caffeine and high-calorie diet: more muscle, less fat](https://www.ergo-log.com/combination-salbutamol-caffeine-high-calorie-diet-more-muscle-less-fat.html)

>*During a low-calorie slimming diet, pharmacological strength athletes sometimes use beta-2 agonists such as salbutamol to* ***lose more fat*** *and at the same time* ***retain more muscle***. *According to obesity researchers at the American Pennington Biomedical Research Center, salbutamol can also* ***improve body composition*** *during a high-calorie diet if you combine salbutamol with caffeine*.

***Salbutamol Stack***

Even more effective than an ECA stack is **Salbutamol** with caffeine. [This stack](https://www.ergo-log.com/combination-salbutamol-caffeine-high-calorie-diet-more-muscle-less-fat.html) is more effective than ephedrine while  being far safer than clenbuterol.

* **Last 4-6 Weeks:** Salbutamol/Caffeine, 4mg/200mg, up to 3xED

### **ECA Stack**

Another thing to consider is using a **ECA** (**ephedrine, caffeine, aspirin**) or **EC** (**ephedrine, caffeine**) stack. This will function as an appetite suppressant and accelerate your metabolism and hence aid tremendously on a cut:

* **Last 4-6 Weeks:** [ECA or EC Stack](/steroids/eca_stack.md), Up To 3xED

If you use Test E & C, it takes about six weeks to fully saturate the blood (i.e. kick in). If you don't want to wait that long and you want to aid in your cut, a popular thing to do is start the oral from day 1 (kickstarting). Another popular thing to do is to run your oral at the very end of your cycle, leading up to PCT (finisher). You can run your oral anytime during the cycle though. You may pick **one** of the following:

* **For 6 Weeks:** [Winstrol (Winny)](/steroids/winstrol.md), 40-80 mg, ED **or**
* **For 6 Weeks:** [Epistane (Epi)](/steroids/epitiostanol.md), 40-80 mg, ED **or**
* **For 6 Weeks:** [Anavar (Var)](/steroids/anavar.md), 40-80 mg, ED

**Nutrition:**

It is recommended to keep your caloric intake at no less than 80% TDEE.

## Very Advanced Insulin Cycle

#### [Read the Insulin Compound Description Page](/steroids/insulin.md)

**WARNING: Insulin use is VERY DANGEROUS. You can, quite literally, DIE FROM IT if not done properly.  This guide is to serve as only an example of what some people do in order to start using it.**

|------------ READ -------------------------------------------------------------------------|

1. **Insulin can easily kill you if mis-used.  Do not fuck around.**
2. **BUDDY SYSTEM ALWAYS!  Have a knowledgeable buddy with you**
3. **DO NOT go to sleep for two hours after insulin use**
4. **Keep emergency glucose tablets on hand.  If you feel like shit, you need more glucose.**
5. **You must have your eating plan tuned to near perfection**

|------------ THIS -------------------------------------------------------------------------|

I’ll use the 5 day training split as an example here. That will give you 20 days “on” insulin.

**Day 1**: 5 IU insulin / 50g Dextrose

**Day 2**: 5 IU insulin / 50g Dextrose

**Day 3**: 5 IU insulin / 50g Dextrose

Congratulations!! You’ve survived thus far. I assume(hope) you’ve been monitoring your BG levels. You probably have noticed that you are in the higher range using 50 g of dextrose PWO. Now it’s time to drop the carbs slightly. Don’t fret. This should be more than ample amounts(of carbs) to get you through to your PPWO meal.

**Day 4**: 5 IU insulin / 40g Dextrose

**Day 5**: 5 IU insulin / 40g Dextrose

At this point you should have a good idea of how you react with Insulin in terms of blood glucose (BG) levels *vs*. carbohydrate intake .

Let’s up the dose …

**Day 6**: 6 IU insulin / 50g Dextrose

**Day 7**: 6 IU insulin / 50g Dextrose

By this point in time you should be feeling good (*i.e.* more confident) but still respectful to Insulin. Let’s test the waters for three days to give you the feel of things. By that I mean we’ll drop the carb intake slightly so you can find a comfortable ratio in regards to IU’s vs. carbs per gram.

**Day 8**: 6 IU insulin / 40g Dextrose

**Day 9**: 6 IU insulin / 40g Dextrose

**Day 10**: 6 IU insulin / 40g Dextrose

Now, the above ratios are safe and effective. You can stop right here and continue on for the next 10 days at the above doses/ratios. Or you can move forward slightly.

**Day 11**: 7 IU insulin / 50g Dextrose

**Day 12**: 7 IU insulin/50 g Dextrose

**Day 13**: 7 IU insulin/50 g Dextrose

**Day 14**: 7 IU insulin/50 g Dextrose

**Day 15**: 7 IU insulin/50 g Dextrose

If you felt confident with the above protocol, you could experiment on days 14-15 and drop your dextrose to 40g.  If you do so, please monitor your BG levels every 15 minutes or so. Have glucose tabs, or another source of quick carbs handy (*like orange juice*) to stave off any possible signs of hypoglycemia. Should this happen, don't panic, just drink a glass of orange juice, or similar, and in 10 minutes the symptoms will have subsided.

OK, on to your final week.

**Day 16**: 8 IU insulin / 60g Dextrose

**Day 17:** 8 IU insulin / 60g Dextrose

**Day 18**: 8 IU insulin / 60g Dextrose

**Day 19**: 8 IU insulin / 60g Dextrose

**Day 20**: 8 IU insulin / 60g Dextrose

**Congratulations**! You just completed your first cycle/experience with Insulin in a safe an effective manner. I stopped at 8 IU, being that is enough to get your feet wet with the drug. You can experiment later on. This was simply a guide.

One last thing. Guys ask “Which way is better?” to take your Whey/Dextrose in one shake, or Dextrose first, and whey 15 minutes later”? Bottom line, it’s just preference.
