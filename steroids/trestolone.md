##Description

**Trestolone** (**MENT**) is an experimental androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) and progestogen medication under development by the USG and university partners for potential use as a form of hormonal birth control for men and in androgen replacement therapy for low testosterone levels in men, but has never been marketed for medical use. 

The compound is an extremely potent 19-nor derivative oft-described as a cross between tren and deca‚Äîbut without any of the negative sides of either. Perhaps more so than any other compound, MENT is highly capable of eliciting serious gains in mass and strength over a relatively short period of time.

Trestolone delivers 10x more myotropic effect of testosterone. The *myotropic effect* is the effect of building muscle, making trestolone more effective in building muscle than any other commercial steroid in existence. In fact, trestolone outperforms trenbolone by a whopping 250% in this area. It's oft-described as ‚Äútest on steroids‚Äù or ‚Äúsupercharged test.‚Äù

##Metabolic Equivalence to Testosterone 

Trestolone is the *only steroid in production today* that is capable of sustaining normal male physiology in the complete absence of testosterone, including sexual functioning.

Trestolone has an anabolic/androgenic rating of 2300:650. In rats, it was found to be roughly ten times as myotropic as methyltestosterone. 

*In some users,* psychological effects MENT conveys include a positive sense of confidence, euthymia and well-being that are noted to be more heightened even than those conveyed by Testosterone, Dianabol, or DHT derivatives Proviron and Masteron.

##Clinical Studies

In a 1992 study in rats investigating the pharmacology of MENT, researchers found the anabolic potency of MENT to be 10x greater than Testosterone, while also being 12x more suppressive to the HTPA. This means that if your average male produces 4-7mg of testosterone daily to keep muscle mass and sexual function, only 400-700mcg of MENT is needed to produce the same results.

In this same study, MENT acetate was used to determine the rate of hydrolysis of the acetate ester and how quickly elevated MENT plasma levels were reached. The half-life is also VERY short, calculated to be only 40 min for the unesterified compound (not the acetate, which should extend the half-life slightly). 

A comprehensive human study conducted on male subjects compared the effects of MENT to testosterone, both accompanied with the progestin etonogestrel, on spermatogenesis, as well as sex drive and safety biomarkers associated with androgen use. This was a robust study, containing 29 subjects tested for 48 weeks.^(8)

Participants either received two implant pellets each containing 135mg of MENT acetate calculated to release 400mcg daily, or three 600mg testosterone pellets, with one given every 12 weeks. Both groups received 68mg of etonogestrel. Both groups experienced significant reduction in sperm production, with 80% of both groups going from an average of 55 x 10^6 mL to just 1 x 10^6 mL after 12 weeks of supplementation.^(8)

Recovery from MENT was *much more rapid* than from testosterone. The recovery period was 16 weeks for the MENT group, in which *semen concentration increased* to over 20 x 10^6 mL‚Äîwhereas the testosterone group *still had azoospermia* until after 28 weeks.^(8)

##Administration Guidelines 

Weekly dosage is low. In clinical studies, the injectable pellets used released between 400-700 micrograms per day as replacement for natural testosterone production values that fall between 4-7 milligrams per day‚Äîas MENT is ten times more myotropic than testosterone.

Experienced users get good results on MENT solo or paired with Test and at doses as little as Trestolone at 5-10mg/day. A typically-used dose level on blast is between 10-25mg/day, but there's no need to rush to higher doses while it's  more prudent to ease into it. Why not? It's designed as a prostate-safe replacement for Testosterone in HRT. As such, you never have to come off it‚Äîyou can just drop back down to a cruise.

Higher end doses range from 25-50 mg per day (175-350/wk) on up to 100 mg/day (700/wk). The compound is extremely well-tolerated, and the  complete lack of sides coupled with its counterintuitive and powerful efficacy makes it a remarkable and unique addition to today's available  selection.

# MENT Example Cycle

MENT can be run *Solo* **OR** *paired* with TRT test (80-150mg).

* As an acetate, it needs to be run ED. Many even dose it *twice a day*. MENT doesn't bind to SHBG. Once it's cleaved from the ester, it's fully metabolized within 40 minutes, leaving no suppressive metabolites.

* Start with it at *Cruise* (400‚Äì700mcg).

* Ease into it at 1-2mg.

* Take some time with it at 5mg.

* A week or two at 10mg.

* Take it up to 25mg. No rush.

* If you're ambitious, you can go to 50, 75, even 100mg ...

* yet many new users experience massive gains in physique, and *lifetime PRs*, on as little as 5‚Äì10mg a day. So why not keep your wallet and save the megadoses for later? There's *no need to rush* into anything higher. This compound will likely be an essential staple in your stack for decades to come. 

* In taking it slowly, you'll find your sweet spot, save your wallet, and simultaneously *guarantee* the absence of any adverse sides.

* When finished just drop back down to a cruise (400‚Äì700 micrograms per day) or ‚Äúenhanced cruise‚Äù (2‚Äì5mg). MENT is intended to serve as a prostate-safe healthy replacement for TRT‚Äîso you don't even have to come completely off of it.

## Super bloat? Crazy gyno? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*Don't believe the hype.* 

7Œ±-Methylestradiol has been shown to be *equipotent* to estrogen at the receptor. It isn't some magic powerful gyno trigger‚Äîespecially when you're taking less than a milligram per day. Any aromatization issues are completely overblown.

Review [these comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/n5fceq/daily_ask_anything_20210505/gx2wic9/?context=3) and subsequent [reply from BicepBandito](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/n5fceq/daily_ask_anything_20210505/gx32oyh/?context=3) in regards to the disinformation and broscience so prevalent in the early *Compound Experience Threads*.

&gt; u/BicepBandito: MENT is my favorite steroid ever after just one run with it. I feel like those old Compound Experience threads were guys just parroting stuff they‚Äôd read. Often if you‚Äôre expecting sides, you‚Äôll find them if you look hard enough, even if they‚Äôre not actually there. *Placebo works both ways*.
&gt;
&gt; MENT used to be *sooo* rare, and wildly expensive, that only a handful of really experienced guys had run it. Not so anymore. Price has come down considerably, and most underground labs seem to be carrying it nowadays. Everyone I know personally that‚Äôs run it has reported *zero sides* other than blood pressure issues at higher doses. I‚Äôve seen *one person* report low *T* symptoms when he tried to run it solo.
&gt;
&gt; I have pretty bad pubertal gyno that Tren fucks with. I ran MENT paired with EQ, and didn‚Äôt touch an AI for my entire cycle. Nothing. At. All. Not a single side effect, other than getting swole as fuck. When I bumped it from 350 to 700, I couldn‚Äôt control my BP even with lots of cardio and meds, so I had to lower it back to 350. That's it. 
&gt;
&gt;It‚Äôs almost like today‚Äôs MENT is a different drug alltogether from those old threads. Maybe synthesizing techniques have changed and it slightly altered things since then? Maybe guys had themselves under the *placebo effect* seeing all these sides that they expected so badly? I assume it‚Äôs the latter. *Anyhooo*. Yeah. That‚Äôs the *real* story.

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Estrogen Management

MENT doesn‚Äôt directly impact estradiol (E2). As 7Œ±-Methylestradiol (7Œ±-Me-E2), it differs from the estrogen produced by Dianabol (17-Œ±), and it doesn't show on bloodwork. 

The 17Œ±-Methylestradiol produced by Dianabol aromatizes at a much lower rate, but it's metabolism-resistant and lingers for a long time, so it can lead to side effects. 

To the contrary, the 7Œ±-Methylestradiol produced from MENT is rapidly rendered inert without suppressive metabolites.

When adding MENT, don't modify estrogen management. EQ/MENT or Primo/MENT ratio doesn't matter as much as the dose of Testosterone you're taking, as that's  going to be the primary aromatizing compound. 

If you start MENT and begin to experience sides, just lower the dose. 7Œ±-Methylestradiol is very quick in/out, so more frequent dosing will cut down on spikes. Treat MENT like TNE‚Äîyou wouldn't adjust your AI dose when introducing TNE. 

* ‚ÄúThere's essentially zero estrogen sides. It's a side-effect-free, more powerful and effective love child of Trenbolone and Nandrolone that's so *ridiculously perfect* it feels almost too good to be true.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúI experienced *no issues* at 350mg a week last off-season and I have absolutely zero idea why anyone would need to run MENT higher than that.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúI have bad pubertal gyno and have run MENT up to 700 *without a single side* other than BP.‚Äù

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/kmdymm/daily_ask_anything_20201229/ghe85an) ‚ÄúIs it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes. E2 management is not as hard as people claim it to be. At 350mg/wk MENT with 200mg Testosterone, I only need 0.25mg Arimidex twice a week on Test injection days. Strength gains are substantial, muscle mass has been increasing rapidly as well. I‚Äôm very pleased with the effects and plan on including it in *all* future cycles.‚Äù

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/hpd5cp/discussion_what_cycle_in_your_lifting_career_has/fxtwq1i) ‚ÄúTen times more myotropic than Testosterone.‚Äù

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/hcmk9e/compound_trestolone_trest_ment/fvhxf4m) ‚ÄúThis compound is God for me. Insane strength, growth and recovery. *Growth is incredible*.‚Äù

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/h8gmm4/trestolone_psa_compound/fur7vxk) ‚Äú10mg gives the same recovery and strength as a gram of test and 200 tren‚Äîwithout why of the sides of either.‚Äù

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/fxrzrb/daily_ask_anything_20200409/fmyx6iv) ‚ÄúLike a cross between Tren and Deca‚Äîwithout any of the negative sides. Far stronger than both combined: ‚Äò*Test on test*‚Äô or ‚Äò*Super-test*.‚Äô‚Äù

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/k5wrhv/daily_ask_anything_20201203/gei70ff) ‚ÄúEvery single stage has been absolutely incredible as far as pushing more weight and building muscle even in a deficit. It's amazing.‚Äù

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/k5wrhv/daily_ask_anything_20201203/gehnye7) ‚ÄúTest and Trest are the ideal synergistic combo. The duo can be used in *cutting* as well as lean bulking.‚Äù
