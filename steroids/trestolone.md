##Description

**Trestolone** (**MENT**) is an experimental androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) and progestogen medication under development by the USG and university partners for potential use as a form of hormonal birth control for men and in androgen replacement therapy for low testosterone levels in men, but has never been marketed for medical use. 

The compound is an extremely potent 19-nor derivative oft-described as a cross between tren and deca—but without any of the negative sides of either. Perhaps more so than any other compound, MENT is highly capable of eliciting serious gains in mass and strength over a relatively short period of time.

Trestolone delivers 10x more myotropic effect of testosterone. The *myotropic effect* is the effect of building muscle, making trestolone more effective in building muscle than any other commercial steroid in existence. In fact, trestolone outperforms trenbolone by a whopping 250% in this area. It's oft-described as “test on steroids” or “supercharged test.”

##Metabolic Equivalence to Testosterone 

Trestolone is the *only steroid in production today* that is capable of sustaining normal male physiology in the complete absence of testosterone, including sexual functioning.

Trestolone has an anabolic/androgenic rating of 2300:650.  In rats, it was found to be roughly ten times as myotropic as methyltestosterone. 

*In some users,* psychological effects MENT conveys include a positive sense of confidence, euthymia and well-being that are noted to be more heightened even than those conveyed by testosterone or DHT derivatives Proviron and Masteron.

##Clinical Studies

In a 1992 study in rats investigating the pharmacology of MENT, researchers found the anabolic potency of MENT to be 10X greater than that of testosterone, while also being 12X more suppressive on HTPA. This means that if your average male produces 4-7mg of testosterone daily to keep muscle mass and sexual function, only 400-700mcg of MENT is needed to produce the same results.

In this same study, MENT acetate was used to determine the rate of hydrolysis of the acetate ester and how quickly elevated MENT plasma levels were reached. The half-life is also VERY short, calculated to be only 40 min for the unesterified compound (not the acetate, which should extend the half-life slightly). 

A comprehensive human study conducted on male subjects compared the effects of MENT to testosterone, both accompanied with the progestin etonogestrel, on spermatogenesis, as well as sex drive and safety biomarkers associated with androgen use. This was a robust study, containing 29 subjects tested for 48 weeks.^(8)

Participants either received two implant pellets each containing 135mg of MENT acetate calculated to release 400mcg daily, or three 600mg testosterone pellets, with one given every 12 weeks. Both groups received 68mg of etonogestrel. Both groups experienced significant reduction in sperm production, with 80% of both groups going from an average of 55 x 10^6 mL to just 1 x 10^6 mL after 12 weeks of supplementation.^(8)

Recovery from MENT was *much more rapid* than from testosterone. The recovery period was 16 weeks for the MENT group, in which *semen concentration increased* to over 20 x 10^6 mL—whereas the testosterone group *still had azoospermia* until after 28 weeks.^(8)

##Dosage Guidelines 

Weekly dosage is low. In clinical studies, the injectable pellets used released between 400-700 micrograms per day as replacement for natural testosterone production values between 4-7 milligrams per day—ten times the strength of testosterone.

A common dose for AAS users is 10 mg per day, or 70 mg per week. Blast dosages are anywhere from 25-50 mg per day, or 175-350 mg per week, on up to 100 mg/day. The compound's tolerance and lack of sides at these levels is remarkable and unique to the compound.

## Estrogen Management

MENT doesn’t directly impact estradiol (E2). As 7α-Methylestradiol (7α-Me-E2), it differs from the estrogen produced by Dianabol (17-α), and it doesn't show on bloodwork. 

When adding MENT, don't modify estrogen management. EQ/MENT or Primo/MENT ratio doesn't matter as much as the dose of Testosterone you're taking, as that's  going to be the primary aromatizing compound. 

If you start MENT and begin to experience sides, just lower the dose. 7α-Methylestradiol is very quick in/out, so more frequent dosing will cut down on spikes. Treat MENT like TNE—you wouldn't adjust your AI dose when introducing TNE. 

* “There's essentially zero estrogen sides. It's a side-effect-free, more powerful and effective love child of Trenbolone and Nandrolone that's so ridiculously perfect it feels almost too good to be true.”

* “I experienced no issues at 350mg a week last off-season and I have absolutely zero idea why anyone would need to run MENT higher than that.”

* “I have bad pubertal gyno and have run MENT up to 700 without a single side other than BP.”

## Reviews

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/hmc6rh/discussion_what_are_your_unpopular_opinionshot/fxt897j) “I can’t say that anything I’ve ever taken or any stack ever felt like this.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/kmdymm/daily_ask_anything_20201229/ghe85an) “Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes. E2 management is not as hard as some people claim it to be. At 350mg/wk Trestolone, 200mg Testosterone, I only need to take 0.25mg Arimidex twice a week on Test injection days. Strength gains are substantial, muscle mass has been increasing rapidly as well. I’m very pleased with the effects and plan on including it in all my future cycles.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/hpd5cp/discussion_what_cycle_in_your_lifting_career_has/fxtwq1i) “Ten times more myotropic than Testosterone.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/hcmk9e/compound_trestolone_trest_ment/fvhxf4m) “This compound is God for me. Insane strength, growth and recovery. Growth is incredible.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/h8gmm4/trestolone_psa_compound/fur7vxk) “10 mg gives the same recovery and strength as a gram of test and 200 tren—without the side effects of either.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/k3vb9z/offtopic_daily_chat_20201130/ge6nnds/) “the best I've ever felt in my life.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/k3vb9z/offtopic_daily_chat_20201130/ge669wp) “The absolute best thing I’ve done since starting testosterone. Hands down the best call I’ve ever made. It’s crazy what this stuff can do. I’m hugely impressed.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/fxrzrb/daily_ask_anything_20200409/fmyx6iv) “Like a cross between Tren and Deca—without any of the negative sides. Far stronger than both combined: ‘*Test on test*’ or ‘*Super-test*.’”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/k5wrhv/daily_ask_anything_20201203/gei70ff) “Every single stage has been absolutely incredible as far as pushing more weight and building muscle even in a deficit. It's amazing.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/k5wrhv/daily_ask_anything_20201203/gehnye7) “Test and Trest are the ideal synergistic combo. The duo can be used in cutting as well as lean bulking.”
