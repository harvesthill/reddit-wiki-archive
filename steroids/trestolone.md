# Trestolone

aka Trestolone Acetate, 7*α*\-**methyl**\-19-**nortestosterone** (MENT)

**Anabolic/Androgenic Ratio:** 2300:650  

**CAS**\#: 3764-87-2

**Chemical Structure:** 7α-Methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one

**Molecular Weight:**  288.431 g/mol g·mol(sup)-1

##Description

**Trestolone** (**MENT**) is an experimental androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) and SARM medication under development by the US Government, The Population Council, and university partners for potential use as a form of hormonal birth control for men and in androgen replacement therapy for low Testosterone levels in men, but has never been marketed for medical use. 

The compound is an extremely potent 19-nor derivative oft-described as a cross between Trenbolone and Nandrolone—but without many of the worst negative sides of either. Perhaps more so than any other compound, MENT is highly capable of eliciting serious gains in mass and strength over a relatively short period of time.

Trestolone delivers 10x more myotropic effect than testosterone. The *myotropic effect* is the effect of building muscle, making Trestolone more effective than any other commercial steroid in existence. Whereas Trenbolone's Anabolic/Androgenic ratio is 500/500 to Testosterone's 100/100, MENT comes in at 2300/650. It's oft-described as “Test on steroids” or “supercharged Test.”

###Equivalence to Testosterone 

Trestolone is the *only steroid in production today* that is capable of sustaining normal male physiology in the complete absence of testosterone, including sexual functioning.

Trestolone's anabolic/androgenic rating of 2300/650 is higher than nearly any other available compound aside from designer Trenbolone analogue Methyltrienolone, *aka* Mtren, Metribolone, which is rated at 12000+/6000+, and is also dosed in the microgram range, between 500–1500mcg. Mtren is of course *so* strong that it's used as the absolute reference standard for laboratory tests to measure binding to the androgen receptor (AR)—but its acute toxicity precludes widespread use. 

In rats, MENT was found to be roughly ten times as myotropic as Methyltestosterone. 

In many users, MENT conveys psychological effects including a positive sense of confidence, euthymia and well-being that are noted to be more heightened and notable than those conveyed by Testosterone, Dianabol, or DHT derivatives Proviron and Masteron.

##Clinical Studies

In a 1992 study in rats investigating the pharmacology of MENT, researchers found the anabolic potency of MENT to be 10x greater than Testosterone, while also being 12x more suppressive to the HTPA. This means that if your average male produces 4-7mg of testosterone daily to keep muscle mass and sexual function, only 400-700mcg of MENT is needed to produce the same results. One contraceptive study used one, two and four patches that released 400mcg per day each, for an effective daily dose of 400mcg, 800mcg, and 1600mcg (1.6mg).

### Neuroprotective?

At least one MS (multiple sclerosis) study shows MENT to be **neuroprotective** and to *actively repair neurological damage* to the myelin sheath. 

* [The neural androgen receptor: A therapeutic target for myelin repair in chronic demyelination](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235386245_The_neural_androgen_receptor_A_therapeutic_target_for_myelin_repair_in_chronic_demyelination)

&gt; The potent synthetic testosterone analogue 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT), developed for long-term male contraception and androgen replacement therapy in hypogonadal males and does not stimulate prostate growth, also *efficiently promotes myelin repair*. 

&gt; These data establish the efficacy of androgens as remyelinating agents and qualify the brain androgen receptor as a promising drug target for remyelination therapy, thus providing the preclinical rationale for a novel therapeutic use of androgens in males with multiple sclerosis.

Another study that discusses the neuroprotective effects of SARM RAD140 tangentially mentions  MENT as one of the sole SARMs compatible with the aromatase enzyme, and hence benefiting from the neuroprotective advantages of metabolite 7α-Methylestradiol.

### Prostate-safe 

Several studies discuss MENT's lack of 5-HT reduction and prostate-safe effects. Prostate cancer is the second leading cancer among aging men in terms of both prevalence and cause of death, is androgen-dependent and typically treated by androgen deprivation therapy. MENT holds potential as replacement to Testosterone in these cases.

* [Protective actions of sex steroid hormones in Alzheimer's disease](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19427328) 

* [7 alpha-methyl-nortestosterone (MENT): the optimal androgen for male contraception](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8489761/)

&gt; There is a need for an androgen preparation that provides appropriate, continuous replacement doses over long periods. An important feature of MENT is that it does not undergo 5 alpha- reduction in prostate as does testosterone. As a consequence, a dose of MENT sufficient to maintain normal muscle mass and gonadotrophin secretion will not hyperstimulate the prostate because its action in this organ is not amplified as is that of testosterone. Thus, MENT can be administered to men with the assurance that it will be less prone to cause diseases of the prostate than testosterone.

&gt; Conclusions: (i) *MENT is the first androgen that has a health benefit compared to testosterone*; (ii) MENT will be promoted as one component of a two-implant system for male contraception, the other component being an implant that will release an LHRH analogue; (iii) MENT has potential uses in patients with a variety of disorders, including hypogonadism, prostatic hyperplasia and muscle wasting.

&gt;	An important feature of MENT is that it does not undergo 5 alpha-reduction in prostate as does testosterone. As a consequence, a dose of MENT sufficient to maintain normal muscle mass and gonadotrophin secretion will not hyperstimulate the prostate because its action in this organ is not amplified as is that of testosterone. Thus, MENT can be administered to men with the assurance that it will be less prone to cause diseases of the prostate than testosterone.

&gt;	Thus, MENT is less apt to cause benign prostatic hypertrophy and, possibly, prostate cancer than is testosterone. *MENT is the first androgen to promote health* (*i.e*., reduction of the incidence of prostate disease). Clinicians may also be able to use MENT to treat hypogonadism, prostatic hyperplasia, and muscle wasting.

### Half-life 

In a study on the compound's half-life, MENT acetate was used to determine the rate of hydrolysis of the acetate ester and how quickly elevated MENT plasma levels were reached. The half-life is also VERY short, calculated to be only 40 min for 500mcg of unesterified compound injected IV. A Swedish study^(9) injecting MENT Acetate IM found a longer half-life of 224 minutes due to the extended absorption time of IM. Peak MENT concentrations were dose-dependent and were reached about 1–2 hours after the injections. This short half-life mandates twice a day dosing to maintain stable plasma levels of the Acetate ester. Enanthate and Decanoate formulations with significantly longer half-life values are also commercially available. 

### Rapid Recovery 

A comprehensive human study conducted on male subjects compared the effects of MENT to Testosterone, both *solo* and accompanied with the progestin Etonogestrel, on spermatogenesis, sex drive, and safety biomarkers associated with androgen use. This was a robust study, containing 29 subjects tested for 48 weeks.^(8)

Participants either received two implant pellets each containing 135mg of MENT acetate calculated to release 400mcg daily, or three 600mg Testosterone pellets, with one given every 12 weeks. Both groups received 68mg of Etonogestrel. Both groups experienced significant reduction in sperm production, with 80% of both groups going from an average of 55 x 10^6 mL to just 1 x 10^6 mL after 12 weeks of supplementation.^(8)

Recovery from MENT was *much more rapid* than from testosterone. The recovery period was 16 weeks for the MENT group, in which *semen concentration increased* to over 20 x 10^6 mL—whereas the Testosterone group *still had azoospermia* until after 28 weeks.^(8)

## Administration Guidelines 

Weekly dosage is low. In clinical studies, the injectable pellets used released between 400-700 micrograms per day as replacement for natural Testosterone production values that fall between 4-7 milligrams per day—as MENT is ten times more myotropic than Testosterone. Contraceptive studies found that implants timed to release 400, 800 and 1600 mcg per day were both well-tolerated and consistent in ensuring that patients were azoospermic below fertility threshold values.

Many cruise on MENT solo, or paired with Test, at 400-700mcg/day, and for weightlifting purposes it's possible to get good results on MENT solo at doses as little as 5-10mg/day. Higher-end doses range from 10-25 (70-175/wk), 25-50 (175-350/wk), on up to 100 mg/day (700/wk). In sensitive individuals, sides such as high blood pressure, gynecomastia, or night sweats may manifest at the higher end of the dosage range, making it imperative to titrate up from cruise.

There's no need to rush into taking higher doses. It's far more prudent to ease into it and take the minimum dose required. MENT is a relatively new and untested compound. Harm reduction would dictate administering the minimum required and titrating dosage upwards. As MENT is designed as a prostate-safe replacement for Testosterone in TRT/HRT, in theory you never have to come off it—you can just drop back down to a cruise of ~400-700 mcg/day.

The compound is extremely well-tolerated, and the complete absence of sides at the optimal dosing range, coupled with its counterintuitive and powerful efficacy, makes Trestolone a remarkable and unique addition to today's available range of anabolic compounds.

### MENT Example Cycle

MENT can be run *Solo* **OR** *paired* with TRT Testosterone (80-150mg).

* As a short-ester Acetate, it needs to be run every day (ED) at minimum, and *twice a day* for enhanced stability. MENT doesn't bind to SHBG, so it's fully metabolized in no time flat. 

* Start with it at *Cruise* (400–700mcg).

* Ease into it at 1-2 mg/day. Note any results. 

* Try a week or more at 5 mg/day. Again pay close attention to any mental or physical changes. How's your sleep, mood, appetite? Many users experience heretofore unheard-of physique and strength gains, and record-shattering PR (1RM) lifts, even at this low dose regime. 

* If you're interested in dosing higher, take a week or two at 5mg, or *slowly* work your way to 10mg.  Closely keep track of any changes along the way.

* If well-tolerated, the daily dose can be taken to 25mg. Splitting it into multiple injections reduces any potential sides. There's no rush. Note the incidence of sides increases with higher doses. 

* If you're ambitious, you can go to 50, 75—even 100mg. It's little-explored at these levels, and safety studies haven't yet been conducted here, so you're in uncharted terrain.

* Many users experience massive gains in physique and *lifetime PRs* on as little as 5–10mg per day. Why not keep the doses low, keep your wallet intact, and save the megadoses for later? There's *no need to rush* into anything higher. The compound will likely be an essential staple in your stack for decades to come. 

* In taking it slowly, you'll find your sweet spot, save your wallet, and simultaneously *guarantee* the absence of adverse side effects.

* When finished, just drop back down to a cruise (400–700 micrograms per day) or “enhanced cruise” (2–5mg). MENT is intended to serve as a prostate-safe and healthy replacement for TRT—so it's not necessary to completely come off of it.

### Super bloat? Crazy gyno? 

Concerned by the sides mentioned in the older Compound Experience Threads?

*Don't believe the hype.* 

A MENT solo cruise as HRT/TRT replacement for 22 consecutive weeks [yields estrogen values](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/nlgfsc/daily_ask_anything_20210526/gzjlog1/) of about *5* pg/mL as shown on LC-MS/MS sensitive bloodwork.  

5-Methylestradiol has been shown to be *equipotent* to estrogen at the receptor. It isn't some magic powerful gyno trigger—especially when you're taking less than a milligram per day. Any aromatization issues are completely overblown.

For those who believe MENT is particularly estrogenic, see [this chart](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPIavffgeso/),  which demonstrates near equivalent aromatization to 19-nortestosterone (Nandrolone). 

Review [these recent comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/n5fceq/daily_ask_anything_20210505/gx2wic9/?context=3) and subsequent [reply from BicepBandito](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/n5fceq/daily_ask_anything_20210505/gx32oyh/?context=3) in regards to the disinformation and broscience so prevalent in the early Experience Threads.

&gt; u/BicepBandito: MENT is my favorite steroid ever after just one run with it. I feel like those old Compound Experience threads were guys just parroting stuff they’d read. Often if you’re expecting sides, you’ll find them if you look hard enough, even if they’re not actually there. *Placebo works both ways*.
&gt;
&gt; MENT used to be *sooo* rare, and wildly expensive, that only a handful of really experienced guys had run it. Not so anymore. Price has come down considerably, and most underground labs seem to be carrying it nowadays. Everyone I know personally that’s run it has reported *zero sides* other than blood pressure issues at higher doses. I’ve seen *one person* report low *T* symptoms when he tried to run it solo.
&gt;
&gt; I have pretty bad pubertal gyno that Tren fucks with. I ran MENT paired with EQ, and didn’t touch an AI for my entire cycle. Nothing. At. All. Not a single side effect, other than getting swole as fuck. When I bumped it from 350 to 700, I couldn’t control my BP even with lots of cardio and meds, so I had to lower it back to 350. That's it. 
&gt;
&gt;It’s almost like today’s MENT is a different drug alltogether from those old threads. Maybe synthesizing techniques have changed and it slightly altered things since then? Maybe guys had themselves under the *placebo effect* seeing all these sides that they expected so badly? I assume it’s the latter. *Anyhooo*. Yeah. That’s the *real* story.

Here's some ***more recent***—and hence relevant—Compound Experience Threads:

### Estrogen Management

MENT doesn’t directly impact estradiol (E2). As 7α-Methylestradiol (7α-Me-E2), it differs from the estrogen produced by Dianabol (17-α), and it doesn't show on bloodwork. 

The 17α-Methylestradiol produced by Dianabol aromatizes at a much lower rate, but it's metabolism-resistant and lingers for a long time, so it can lead to side effects. 

*Contra* Dianabol's 17α-Me-E2, the 7α-Methylestradiol produced from MENT is rapidly rendered inert without suppressive metabolites.

When adding MENT, don't modify estrogen management. EQ/MENT or Primo/MENT ratio doesn't matter as much as the dose of Testosterone you're taking, as that's going to be the primary aromatizing compound unless solo. 

If you start MENT and begin to experience sides, just lower the dose. 7α-Methylestradiol is very quick in and out, so more frequent dosing will cut down on spikes. Treat MENT like TNE—you wouldn't adjust your AI dose when introducing TNE.

⚠️ Some users report trouble managing aromatization with MENT. Have Aromasin, Nolvadex or Raloxifine at the ready. On the other hand, the majority of users present with no sides. If you follow guidelines and titrate up from a cruise, this should never become an issue.

* “There's essentially zero E2 sides. It's a side-effect-free, more powerful and effective love child of Trenbolone and Nandrolone that's so *ridiculously perfect* it feels almost too good to be true.”

* “I experienced *no issues* at 350mg a week last off-season and I have absolutely zero idea why anyone would need to run MENT higher than that.”

* “I have bad pubertal gyno and have run MENT up to 700 *without a single side* other than BP.”

* [Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/kmdymm/daily_ask_anything_20201229/ghe85an) “Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes. E2 management is not as hard as people claim it to be. At 350mg/wk MENT with 200mg Testosterone, I only need 0.25mg Arimidex twice a week on Test injection days. Strength gains are substantial, muscle mass has been increasing rapidly as well. I’m very pleased with the effects and plan on including it in *all* future cycles.”
