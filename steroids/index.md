## What Are Steroids?

The term ‚Äústeroids‚Äù refers to a *class of hormones with a classic polyphenol ring structure that are derived from the cholesterol molecul**. There are two types of steroids. They are often confused: **Anabolic** and **Catabolic**. These two steroids serve different medical purposes.

## Catabolic Steroids (Glucocorticoids)

A group of steroid hormones produced in the adrenal cortex or made synthetically. They have various metabolic functions and are used to treat inflammation.

**Glucocorticoids are utilized to treat:**

* Arthritis
* Asthma
* Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis
* Skin conditions such as eczema and rashes
* Some kinds of cancer

Side effects of glucocorticoids can include fat gain (particularly trunk), muscle atrophy, weakened bones, and cataracts.

## Anabolic Steroids (AAS)

A synthetic steroid hormone that resembles Testosterone in promoting the growth of muscle. Such hormones are used medicinally to treat some forms of weight loss and by some athletes and others to enhance physical performance. The proper term for these compounds is Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids (AAS).

**Use of anabolic steroids can have side effects including:**
* Acne and cysts
* Breast growth and shrinking of testicles in men
* Voice deepening and growth of body hair
* Heart problems, including heart attack
* Liver disease, including cancer
* Aggressive behavior

See *[Additional Sides](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/sides/list)*

## How Do Anabolic Steroids Work?

There are generally considered to be three mechanisms of action of AAS.

**1**. By binding to the androgen receptor located in the cytoplasm, AAS stimulate protein synthesis in the muscle. 

**2**. AAS bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, blocking the catabolic actions of cortisol on muscle (protein breakdown). 

**3**. Psychological effects include increased motivation and aggression, leading to increased training intensity.

See *[Pharmacology of AAS](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2439524/).*

## Are AAS Dangerous?

The general consensus is that if used properly, in conjunction with blood tests, AAS can be used safely. However, the potential side effects can be extreme if they are used incorrectly. Most commonly, a lipid profile imbalance which favors plaque deposition in the arteries occurs. The strict diet of most bodybuilders means this is minimized by a low fat intake.

Liver problems can occur with the use of 17Œ±-alkylated oral anabolic steroids. Rare cases of hepatic peliosis (blood filled cysts in the liver), more commonly known as a liver cancer, have been associated with the use of oral AAS. While these cases have been rare, they emphasize the need for blood testing during a cycle.

Gynecomastia can occur as a result of high levels of Testosterone being partially converted to estrogen, the primary metabolite being estradiol (E2). The enzyme responsible for this conversion is called *aromatase*. It can be inhibited by a class of drugs called Aromatase Inhibitors (AI). Another class of drugs called a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), such as Raloxifine or Nolvadex, can also be used because it blocks estrogen from binding with the estrogen receptor, rather than the binding with the enzyme that metabolizes from Testosterone to Estrogen.

## Are There Any Long-Term Effects?

AAS have been used in humans to improve performance since the 1930s. This was a crude extract from male dog urine. Nazi paratroopers were thought to be the first to take Testosterone for performance. In the fifties, drug development company Ciba developed Dianabol‚Äîand the race was then on to find the best steroid in terms of anabolic-androgenic dissociation.

The long history of use by many thousands of people has shown that if used reasonably, most people do not experience any long-term adverse effects. However, there is a distinct lack of research in this area, with the occasional case study in the medical literature. The mass media likes to sensationalize the death of any past steroid user.

The fact is, the most likely problem would be an increase in arterial plaque deposition as a result of an unfavorable blood lipid levels. This does not affect all users, hence another reason for blood testing.

**There is strong evidence to suggest that brief exposure to anabolic steroids might have long lasting performance-enhancing effects**: 

* *[A cellular memory mechanism aids overload hypertrophy in muscle long after an episodic exposure to anabolic steroids](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.264457/abstract)*

## Should I Begin Taking Anabolic Steroids?

*The generally accepted criteria for starting AAS is as follows:*

1. Research until you have a very good understanding of what you are considering putting into your body. **Do this PRIOR to your cycle**.

2. If you are ***under 25 years of age*** you have a heightened risk of incurring *permanent damage* from a cycle. There's also a much higher risk of unwanted side effects. Wait until you're at least 25.

3. Do not run a cycle without having a **PCT** and an **AI** on hand. If you can't afford either, you can't afford to cycle.

4. The best first cycle is a simple first cycle. **KISS**. As more experience is gained and you learn how your body reacts to gear, cycles can become more complex. Adding two previously unused elements to a cycle makes it impossible to know which thing may be causing issues. One new compound at a time, and grow into your dose. You don't need grams and grams of gear. 

5. ***Steroids are magic***. But just like any spell, this magic doesn't work without the right incantation. That incantation, in this case, is a very good *caloric surplus*, **healthy diet** and **progressive overload exercise** regime. With these factors in place, keep your expectations reasonable and you'll be happy.

6. For your cycle duration, **remain aware** of how your body is reacting both physically and emotionally. If something feels "off" or "not right", and it's not a known side, it probably isn't right. Typical beginner cycles make people feel very good overall.

## Can I Do This Naturally?

You will eventually reach a genetic potential maximum ([calculate yours here](http://www.weightrainer.net/bodypred.html)) with regards to strength and size. There are often people giving advice to "reach your genetic maximum potential first" before using gear. Some at /r/steroids give and promote this advice, some do not. This advice is preference.

# Why Young Men Should Not Take AAS

[Originally](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/1tup8j/why_young_men_shouldnt_take_aas/) by /u/hypnotoadIRL
## Introduction 

**Not yet. Minimum Age 25**.

You aren't *old enough* to be using. 

Exogenous androgens act as epigenetic growth signaling termination factors. 

**TRANSLATION**: it isn't just your height that's stunted. It's your IQ. AAS atrophy brain development and higher cognitive functions. 

Clinical studies showed this leads to ***long-term aggression, anxiety, depression, cognitive deficits and memory problems***‚Äî*among others.*

You're smart. Use foresight. Think ahead. 

[Wait until the age MRI scans show developmental completion at the age of ***25***.](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/index#wiki_.1F481.1F3FC.200D.2640.FE0F.1F4F0__why_young_men_should_not_take_aas)

***Until then***, train natty. If you have ***low T symptoms***, Clomid monotherapy or hCG-only cycles function as far safer alternatives to taking steroids. Read the Wiki section on hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Consult with a family physician for a referral to an endocrinologist. 

Right now you're at peak Testosterone output, peak natty growth potential, and the perfect time to bulk naturally.  

&gt; Don't short-circuit your brain and body natural direction when it's so young and vulnerable and pure‚Äîand at the highest it will ever be in your lifetime.

&gt; Don't shut down your neuroendocrine system while it's still developing and primed for pumping out hormones at *peak natural production*.

&gt; Don't pick up powerful exogenous hormones with the potential for ***permanent***, ***life***\-***changing disabilities*** if you're not finished growing and don't yet have a *thorough* understanding of their impact.

It's not just your *height* that's stunted by taking steroids too young, it's *your brain*.

MRI scans show that the adolescent brain and neuroendocrine system growth and development continues until the ***age of 25***. The last regions to finish growing are the *absolute most important‚Äîthose associated with consciousness, sense of self, abstract reasoning, conscientiousness, high-bandwidth emotional processing, higher cognition and impulse control*. 

*While still under the age of* ***25***, the fragile connections that make up your newly-forged neural pathways are far more exposed and vulnerable to the potential for permanent damage than previously set, well-worn and established pathways. 

You wouldn't play Russian roulette with a cheap bottle of vodka and a loaded handgun aimed directly at your head. Don't play Russian roulette with your developing brain and body. Your fertility, family, and future fulfillment are on the line. Don't take any chances. Don't leave it to luck. Take back your power and exercise it while you can. 

Having temporary glycogen-inflated muscles that deflate like balloons as soon as you come off just isn't worth the added risk of long-term aggression, anxiety and depression. It's not worth the learning disorders and memory deficits. It's not worth all the unpredictable lifelong consequences of stunted growth triggered by the interplay of different androgen markers‚Äîand neuron apoptosis, or cell death, consequent the unprotected excitotoxicity of a blast.

### Environmental Toxins

One of the most devastating modern environmental catastrophes is global pollution from [petrochemical and plastics industries](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Swan+SH&amp;cauthor_id=25697839)‚Äîmanmade chemicals such as Bisphenol-A that mimic the function of Estrogen. Testosterone levels in the average 20-year-old male have [dropped by 50% in the last 20 years alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/n04bgv/plastics_have_reduced_testosterone_levels_by_50/). Just like AAS, these estrogen-mimetic compounds affect neurological development *from fetal growth onwards*, with effects that are *cumulative* and *compounded* with any concomitant exposure to AAS.

Aside from detrimental neurophysiological effects, infertility, hair loss, breast enlargement, loss of motivation and libido, and muscle wasting‚Äîthe risks of exposure to exogenous estrogen-mimetic compounds are shared with many of the same risks that are tied to premature AAS usage‚Äîfor obvious reasons: aside from their androgenic effects, the aromatase enzyme metabolizes these compounds to [17Œ≤-Estradiol (E2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol).

The core objective is to minimize exposure to any and all exogenous risk factors. Stay away from these negative environmental influences that *even our immediate ancestors*‚Äîeven your grandparents and great-grandparents‚Äînever had to address. With today's environmental devastation, accelerating climate change, and increasing number of species under threat of endangerment and extinction, you're already far from playing on a level playing field. Don't make it any harder on yourself. You want to make it to their age, and you want to be healthy getting there. 

**Anything exogenous** that could short-circuit the feedback loops controlling neuroendocrine axis growth and development presents a far greater risk of atrophied neural and endocrine functionality, with concomitant and potentially permanent side effects.

At your age you're fortunate to be easily able to pack on slabs of lean mass *without using steroids as a crutch*. It's *not worth the risk* when you've got so many years and so many natural gains still ahead of you. You've barely even started out yet. **Good luck**.

## What's safe?

For hypogonadal patients *under the age of 25* the standard of care medical professionals advise for the treatment of low Testosterone levels is either (**a**) *hCG* or (**b**) *Clomid monotherapy*. Each option has its own unique side effects, relative merits and disadvantages‚Äîbut either one of these two options are far safer, and nowhere near risking the debilitating negative side effects that can come as a consequence of AAS mismanagement or abuse.

## What are the different risks?

&gt;‚ÄúAnabolic steroids have been reported to induce psychiatric side effects such as *aggression* and *depression*. Adolescence represents an *extremely sensitive neurodevelopmental period* to influence by *detrimental effects*.‚Äù

‚Äì *Side Effects of Drugs Annual*

&gt;‚ÄúAAS use by teenagers is a primary concern because of the potential side effects where *remodeling of the brain and behavioral maturation* occurs.‚Äù

‚Äì *Journal of Behavioral Processes*

&gt; ‚ÄúAAS use *impaired spatial learning and memory*, and this effect was not rescued by exercise. The harmful effects of AAS on learning and memory should be taken into account when athletes decide to use them for performance or body image improvement.‚Äù 

&gt; ‚ÄúTestosterone and anabolic steroids have been found to affect the central nervous system (CNS) in humans and laboratory animals. The locations they affect include centers that regulate mood, sexuality and aggression. People who use steroids in excessive doses often experience mood disorders that meet the criteria of psychiatric disease categories such as *depression*, *anxiety*, *psychotic reactions* and *cognitive deterioration*.‚Äù

‚Äì *Anabolic Steroids Cause Longstanding Changes in the Brain*

Until you're around **the age of 25**,^[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621648/), ^[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19609250/) your brain and endocrine system are still developing. This should be obvious as you are still going through the end of puberty, getting acne, etc. During this time period, supplementing with exogenous hormones is *extremely dangerous*.

Taking *anything* before you are completely finished with puberty can have negative side effects. While you are maturing, your brain, organs, and cells are consistently gauging the overall development of your body. When you introduce a foreign substance, you risk your body‚Äôs ability to truly judge how far along your maturation is, resulting in the possibility of premature shutdown or stunting your growth and development processes.

Be the adult you claim to be and make a good decision for your health. A man who has patience and responsibility for his own life and health is vastly more masculine than one jabbing themselves with hormones to get swole prematurely, damned be all the consequences. 

### Don't Short-Circuit Your Natural Blast

Your body is already pumping out blast levels of Testosterone as part of the natural course of late adolescence. It's the highest that it's ever going to be in your lifetime.

Why prematurely shut that down and ruin a great thing? You're essentially on free steroids right now. Don't take that opportunity for granted and abort your own physiological development by injecting additional variables that short-circuit the whole equation.

There's a serious potential for long-term side effects. People oft-say ‚ÄúI've stopped growing, so it's okay.‚Äù No: it's not okay. The rest of you hasn't finished developing yet. There are many other potential side effects besides simply your growth plates. Here are a few.

### Brain Function, Memory, Alzheimers Disease

It's well known that hormones play a role in the development of cognitive brain function. **Your neuroendocrine system is still developing until the age of 25**. 

 Adding external hormones when your brain is still developing can stunt normal development and maturation. All these effects are more serious in still-growing and developing brain:

* *Many steroids are neurotoxic*.

* *They lead to depression, memory loss and learning difficulties*.

* *They cause longstanding dysfunction in the brain's natural reward systems*.

* *They give rise to the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which leads to dementia and early-onset Alzheimers disease*.

Do you really want to add these variables to a still-growing and developing brain? 

How can you know many years down the road there won't be even more problems?

&gt; ‚ÄúMales who begin using anabolic steroids during *teen years* show **increased impulsivity and decreased attention** *compared to men* who began using steroids in their *adult years*. In adolescent rats, anabolic steroid exposure is associated with hyperactivity, anxiety, and increased sympathetic autonomic modulation (*e.g., fight or flight response*) during adulthood, *even when steroid use was discontinued* during adolescence. Adolescent males given anabolic steroids show increased aggression even *after steroid use is discontinued*. These aggressive effects are paralleled by changes in levels of serotonin and androgen receptors in the brain.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúChronic use of anabolic steroids has been shown to cause dysfunction of reward pathways in animals. Rats given twice daily nandrolone injections for four weeks showed loss of sweet preference (*a sign of reward dysfunction*) accompanied by reductions of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline in the nucleus accumbens, a reward-related brain region. These effects persist for long after discontinuation of the drug.‚Äù

‚Äì NIDA 

### Premature Closing of Growth Plates

This one is the most known about. Even if you think you've stopped growing, there still is a potential for height increase over time. Scientists have found that growth plates don't fuse completely in some cases until individuals are past 22. Don't be deterred just because you haven't grown taller in awhile. You grow out as well as up. Do you want broader shoulders, or do you want to stay stuck with what you've got now?

### Cancer, Liver, Kidney Disease

You hear all the time teenagers say ‚ÄúWell, my friends did it and they got big and nothing happened to them.‚Äù Really? How do you know? Have they been to a doctor and had their liver and kidney values checked? Just because a person looks okay on the outside doesn't mean that they don't already host serious problems on the inside. If treated improperly or in an untimely manner, liver and kidney damage can eventually be fatal.

### Impotence

Your neuroendocrine system is still developing. Supplementing with hormones while you are still growing can potentially cause *permanent* impotence and fertility issues in teenagers. When you add testosterone, estrogen and a wealth of other synthetic androgens to your body it can cause problems with your normal testicular growth and function. Remember, some of these effects are more than just temporary.

### Gyno, or ‚ÄúBitch Tits‚Äù

Androgen usage in teens increases the risk of gyno. Gyno has already been known to happen naturally in many teenagers because of fluctuating hormones. When you add more hormones to the mix, you dramatically increase the problems. Remember once you have gyno, it's very hard to get rid of. Unless you take the proper precautions up front, you'll have to resort to surgery and go under the knife.

### Hair Loss, Acne, Prostate Dysfunction

*All of these can be accelerated and aggravated with exogenous androgen use*.

* *Have you seen a 20-year old already going bald?*

* *What about permanent scarring from severe cystic acne?*

* *How about being unable to use the bathroom due to the excruciating pain involved in the process?* 

It's not pretty. Don't think it can't happen to you. 

##Tracking Neurological Development

*Have a look at this research paper that tracks the adolescent brain through various phases of development.* 

### [Maturation of the Adolescent Brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621648/) 

&gt;Neuromorphological, neurochemical, neurophysiological, neurobehavioral, and neuropharmacological evidence suggests that the brain remains in its active state of maturation during adolescence. Such evidence supports the hypothesis that the adolescent brain is *structurally and functionally vulnerable* to environmental stress, risky behavior, drug addiction, impaired driving, and unprotected sex.   
&gt;  
&gt;Computed tomography and MRI studies also provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Brain maturation occurs during adolescence due to a surge in the synthesis of sex hormones implicated in puberty including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. *These sex hormones augment myelinogenesis and the development of the neurocircuitry involved in efficient neurocybernetics*. Although tubulinogenesis, axonogenesis, and synaptogenesis can occur during the prenatal and early postnatal periods, myelinogenesis involved in the insulation of axons remains under construction in adolescence. Sex hormones also significantly influence food intake and sleep requirements during puberty.   
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to dramatic changes in secondary sex characteristics, sex hormones influence learning, intelligence, memory, and behavior of adolescents. The development of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission occurs earlier in the developing brain as compared to GABAergic neurotransmission, which makes the pediatric population susceptible to seizures. *The development and maturation of the prefrontal cortex occurs primarily during adolescence and is* **fully accomplished at the age of 25 years**. The development of the *prefrontal cortex* is very important for complex behavioral performance, as this region of the brain helps accomplish **executive brain functions**.

##Testimonials

*Here's a few firsthand accounts from other young guys who started young, screwed up big time, and now regret it*.

### **Testimonial 1**

&gt; u/ghettotuesday: *I started young*. I did SARMs at eighteen, and ended up doing steroids at nineteen. My hormone production is **fucked** now. I‚Äôm 100% sure that I altered my brain development in a **very negative way**. **If you hop on early you will regret it**. You can get pretty fucking strong naturally. You can spend the next few years doing just that. When you're finished developing, you‚Äôll have every year **after 25** to blast and cruise and get juicy as fuck.
&gt;
&gt; It‚Äôs absolutely astounding to me when I see people defending cycling at 18 and literally abusing their body. One of my biggest life regrets is doing a cycle at 19 before I was ready. Definitely fucked some brain development. Definitely made shitty life choices due to increased impulsivity that I wasn‚Äôt developed enough to reign in. Garbage

### **Testimonial 2**

&gt;*I wish I'd listened* to everyone all over the internet that shouts that **No matter what, DON'T use steroids if you're young**. I did my first cycle at age seventeen. I'd been training for 4.5 years by this point, and while it wasn't obvious to me back then how horrendous it got to be at the time, I became even moodier, angrier and more stubborn, and I couldn't even see it. All the growing health issues are the biggest kicker.  
&gt;  
&gt;My blood pressure was awful for a while. I'd pass out frequently. My testicles took a lot of time to kick back in properly on top of so many other smaller things, so overall it's something I really regret quite a lot.  
&gt;  
&gt;I heard everyone telling me not to take steroids but *I thought I'd be different*‚Äîthe bad stuff wouldn't happen to me, etc, just as I'm sure every kid thinks. just as I'm sure you think. Lo and behold, it did happen, and I can confirm, it is NOT worth it.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you're reading this as a teenager thinking you'll be fine, you'll deal with the consequences later, etc etc, you won't... Just take their advice and wait until you're physically and emotionally more matured and more experienced, you've stopped growing, your body and hormones have steady natural baselines, your brain is matured and your moods are consistent. ‚Äã  
&gt;  
&gt;Ironically, I'm about to hop back on again now... but this is because of my totally trashed hormone levels. I now require lifelong medical intervention to survive. *My T levels are trashed. My thyroid hormones are trashed*. There's no way to know if the reason for my ED, my low levels, my many other problems now is because of the reckless abandonment I treated the issue with way back then. Its already way too late for me but its not too late for you.
&gt;

### **Testimonial 3**

&gt; Hello guys. So. First off i want to be honest with you and i don' t want any disrespect. I'm 19 years old now and i started using back when i was 17. Im stupid i know and i regret it a lot. I was really into bodybuilding and i competed and had good diet and i was pretty big. but now im really fucked.
&gt;  
&gt; Being BIG that was all in my mind and i was saying to myself ahh nothing will happen to me, but my 3rd and 4th cycle i was really suppressed and still recovering even after finishing the pct over a month ago. Now it has been 1 week after the bloodwork. i haven't ever used 19 nors and my cycles were mild and simple. I used winstrol, anavar, dianabol and test e low dosages and did pct on every cycle except the first one but i recovered good until the 3rd.  
&gt;  
&gt; So now i have low libido and ED. im planing to do another pct and stop steroids for good and see if i will recover, maybe i won' t get better maybe i will.. only time will tell.  
&gt;  
&gt; Btw this is not just for me i want the other youngsters that plan to use steroids to read it and i advise you not to start when you are young. I was young and i thought i knew everything and nothing will happen to me. There was only one thing on my mind and that was to get big, but after some time i realized that doesn't matter and my goals faded away over some time and yeah.. .
&gt;  
&gt; The point is you shouldn't start young because you don't know shit first of all and you think you know. We don't even know how to wipe our ass and we are starting to use steroids at young age. While we are young we don't think straight we just look only for the day ahead of us and not our future.  
&gt;  
&gt; We don't even know what we are gonna be when we grow up, maybe that dream will fade away like mine did and you gonna regret what you have done to yourself for the rest of your life. I know because i was thinking that way too.  
&gt;  
&gt; I want to tell you that you don't need muscles to go out with hot girls and you can do it naturally. I've been there and I'm telling you this. Don't start steroids until you know 100% what are you doing with them, the diet and training, if they really fit (or don't) into your long-term future, and wait until your brain and body development is really complete like they suggest.

### **Testimonial 4**

&gt; I started around nineteen. It fucked up my test for life. Now I‚Äôm on TRT at 26 and will be for I guess the rest of my life. Yeah it‚Äôs cool being big but I think if I could go back I probably wouldn‚Äôt do it at all. It‚Äôs just not as important as I thought it was back then.
&gt;
&gt; I started at Test E 200/week. I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a guaranteed path to not fucking up your hormones permanently. I know it‚Äôs a lot coming from a stranger, but before I‚Äôd start anything I would do a little soul searching for why you want to be big. There are a lot of downsides if you end up having to do TRT forever.

### **Testimonial 5**

&gt; I was put on oral test by a quack doctor at ***19*** and I was totally in because I wanted the benefits of Test. I got off because he was quack and expensive AF, but did my first cycle of 400mg test at 21.
&gt;
&gt;I'm 34 now and I've stayed away from AAS for years at a time, but am currently on and spent a few years since on AAS. My natural production is not great, and wasn't really great prior to starting, but if I could go back to 19 with any wisdom in me, I never would have started. I'd try to ride the body I have for what it is worth until it was failing me, either with really shit hormones or I was actually experiencing significant enough sides of aging to bother with TRT.
&gt;
&gt; One of the reasons I love this sub is so many users self-reflect. AAS fuck with your brain, and your well-being. They can make you feel better than you've ever imagined and leave you in a hole that is not easy to climb out of. I started back when there were a lot less people willing to self-reflect, and if I had no idea what it felt like to cycle I would be fine with that. I don't want to lie to you and tell you there's nothing great in steroid use, but for most I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze.
&gt;
&gt; If you decide to go ahead, wait until 25 like the wiki says. 
&gt;
&gt; Something that isn't brought up a ton here that I think deserves more discussion is what actually constitutes a great life. I think so much of a great life is intimacy. The ability to share your experiences and feel seen and heard. Also, to see and hear others. It's why so many users flock to r/steroids, because here we can experience that. When you use gear most people in real life cannot know about it, and even if they can know they can't understand. It serves as another barrier between you and other people that you have to keep hidden in order to be safe and/or respected. 
&gt;
&gt; I'm not suggesting what other people think should drive your decision, but I have found the more things like AAS I've added to my life the more difficult it becomes to really share aspects of my existence. Even though AAS isn't the main ingredient, it is part of so many experiences. 
&gt;
&gt; I'm lucky that I have a few friends that I can talk about this stuff with and now that I'm in my 30's hiding it matters less since I own a home. But dancing around hiding things from 21‚Äì24 with roommates sucked and probably created tensions the same way hiding an affair might. My guilt or discomfort was channeled into situations and there was no way for anyone else to understand or be prepared because I wasn't sharing the why with them. Just party, work out, look the best you can and have some fun with your friends.

### **Testimonial 6**

&gt; ***I took gear at 18. How screwed am I? What do I do?***
&gt;
&gt; **I know I'm an idiot. DON'T touch gear if you're under 25.** 
&gt;
&gt;The pandemic left me with a physique of a bloated whale. I was so motivated to look good I started gear.
&gt;
&gt;I thought I did a shit ton of research. Knew what exactly to use. When to employ an AI. SERM on cycle for gyno flare-up. PCT, injection frequency, *etc*. I had it all dialed in. 
&gt;
&gt;Although everyone on this sub was totally against starting before 25 I did it anyway. What could go wrong? I thought I'd seen enough anecdotal evidence of 18-year olds starting Test and saying it was ‚Äúthe best decision of their lives,‚Äù even though there's absolutely no way to know that, since they haven't even had any time to experience the sides yet. So I said **f*ck it!** and hopped on.
&gt;
&gt;Absolutely NO bloodwork done before or after either cycles ‚Ä¶ one of my greatest regrets. I have no understanding my baseline was, although I'm assuming I was on the higher end of natural Test levels because I was horny 24/7, grew body hair everywhere, voice was relatively deep, and I was able to make solid and fast muscle and strength gains even before hopping on gear.
&gt;
&gt;My first cycle was 16 weeks of 350mg Test E. 350mg was what my ampoules were dosed at. Any higher dose would break the bank as I bought everything from oversea sellers and that shit was expensive as **f*ck**. At the time I didn't even know about locally-produced UGL Test, which is as cheap as a bag of chips lol.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, my cycle was an absolute shitshow. It was this bad:
&gt;
&gt; * I was very very inconsistent with training. I'd train a week then skip 2 just because I *didn't feel like it*.
&gt;
&gt; * My diet was complete garbage. Although I was trying to cut (dumb on a blast, I know), I ended up binge eating as Test increased my appetite tenfold. I already had a big appetite beforehand, so this was a disaster.
&gt;
&gt; * The weeks I trained were enough for me to notice quick mass and strength gains. Muscle memory made me put on muscle at a ridiculous speed.
&gt;
&gt; * Thanks to the (muscle memory + steroids + huge calorie surplus) that I was in, I ended up gaining stretch marks EVERYWHERE. Forearms, chest, deltoids, back, stomach, this shit was everywhere. It destroyed my self-esteem, which was already in the gutter.
&gt;
&gt; * I looked like a fat bloated powerlifter. My face looked the worst it has ever been. People were commenting on how I'd gotten fatter all the goddamn time.
&gt;
&gt; *  Overall it was a wasted failure of a cycle. Didn't gain much but stretch marks and water weight.
&gt;
&gt;I was so demotivated during PCT that I completely stopped training. 
&gt;
&gt;Massive brain fog and social anxiety. I couldn't take it anymore.
&gt;
&gt;This was probably the worst I felt my entire life. 
&gt;
&gt;This was during the start of college. I didn't want to ruin the best years of my life looking and feeling like a cuckold, so I cut it short. I probably ran PCT for about a month before I decided to hop on again. I discovered dirt cheap pharma-grade Test sold in local pharmacies (best thing about being here in Egypt) so I was even more inclined to hop back on cycle.
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm fatter than ever with an even uglier body thanks to the failure of the first cycle. So what did I do? Recklessly hopped on 500mg Test. All that was on my mind was to **look good + f*ck bitches**. Dreams of many an 18-year old. 
&gt; 
&gt; I *still* have all the brain fog and overall I feel like shit. Could it be my low self-esteem, my body, just sides from the gear itself?? No clue.
&gt;
&gt; I'm probably cutting my cycle short at 10 weeks because I've started to come to my senses. I have time to get my training and diet in check *at least until I'm 25.* I can always consider on hopping on gear then. Doing a cycle was a very stupid thing to do and I worry about the potential damage I may have already done.
&gt;
&gt;All these experiences showed me why no 18-year old should EVER touch gear and why I should've took everyone's advice to heart. Other than the potential for *permanent* and life-changing negative mental and physical side effects, no 18-year old has perfect diet and training to make the most out of a premature and harmful cycle anyway. I wasted months of my life harming and damaging my body, perhaps permanently, just to look even worse. This might have been a different story if I had my shit in check, but it would've still been dumb to do at such a young age.
&gt;
&gt;I'm still concerned about a couple of stuff, which is the main reason for this post.
&gt;
&gt; * **Losing the feeling of being "on."** If you were ever on gear, you know that feeling like a beast in the gym. Having some type of drive in life. More energy, more assertiveness. I'm scared of losing that feeling to be honest and going back to what could possibly feeling inferior.
&gt;
&gt;* **Natural Test production**. While I don't mind on being on TRT for life, hopping on ALREADY at this early age while still a teenager would just suck. I still should have a couple of years of high natural Test production if I haven't permanently damaged my HPTA. Very worried about if whether I'll recover or not.
&gt;
&gt;* **Fertility**. This was my biggest worry throughout cycle. I'm keen on the idea of starting a family one day. Will there have been any permanent damage done that can't be recovered with a good PCT and fertility protocol?
&gt; 
&gt;* **Brain damage and cognitive impairment**. I value highly cognitive abilities and hope these 2 cycles had minimal damages done. I didn't touch anything extremely neurotoxic like Tren for example. But weirdly though I still always feel weird since going on cycle. *Brain fog, hazy memory, feeling more stupid, social anxiety, fatigue, etc*. Could I have damaged my brain in just 2 cycles? 
&gt;
&gt;Permanent side effects ‚Ä¶ or will things eventually go back to normal?
&gt;
&gt; **I know I f*cked up** so please go easy on me ‚Ä¶ I went against everyone's advice and deeply regret it.

## Women &amp; AAS

Just as seen in adolescents, the side effects seen in women can be **permanent**. AAS can lower voice, facial hair growth, and induce clitoral enlargement. For this reason, AAS administration to women must be used very cautiously‚Äîif at all.

## Tips For Interpreting Scientific Studies

The number one tip, is ‚Äú*Who stands to gain from this?*‚Äù This is particularly relevant if you found the study quoted by some supplement site, for example.  You should also check at the end of the article to see if there is any disclosure of conflict of interest from the researchers. There should also be information on the source of funding. If it was funded commercially, and one or more of the authors have an interest, beware. Most good journals will cite these things.

You can also look at the reputation of the journal itself. There is a ranking system or journals, but without being a scientist, it is hard to know. For those wanting to read more see [Impact factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor).

Another factor of course is how relevant the research is. Was it in mice? Was it in elderly women? Was the study well designed to test what you want to know?

One interesting area is the reference section. Here you can find yourself valuable information on studies that might be more relevant to what you want. Throughout the text assertions are made that are backed up by prior research. This is then referred to the reference section.  PubMed is wonderful at this as there are related citations to the right side.
